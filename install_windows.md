# List of programs to install on windows

1. WSL. Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications - 
	directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dual-boot setup. 
	This will give us access to more modern commandline interfaces on windows machines.
