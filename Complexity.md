# NP-Complete

>nondeterministic polynomial-time complete

>1.  it is a problem for which the correctness of each solution can be verified quickly (namely, in [polynomial time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial_time "Polynomial time")) and a [brute-force search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brute-force_search "Brute-force search") algorithm can find a solution by trying all possible solutions.
2.  the problem can be used to simulate every other problem for which we can verify quickly that a solution is correct. In this sense, NP-complete problems are the hardest of the problems to which solutions can be verified quickly. If we could find solutions of some NP-complete problem quickly, we could quickly find the solutions of every other problem to which a given solution can be easily verified.
