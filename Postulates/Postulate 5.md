# Postulate 5

> If the measurement of the physical quantity $\hat{A}$ on the system in state $\ket{\psi}$ gives the result $a_i$, the state of the system immediately after the measurement is projected (and normalized) onto the $i^\text{th}$ eigenvector of $\hat{A}$, $\ket{a_i}$. 

$$\ket{\psi} \xrightarrow{a_i} \ket{a_i}$$

This is referred to as `wavefunction collapse`
