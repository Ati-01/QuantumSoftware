# Postulate 4

> When the physical quantity A is measured on a system in a state $\ket{\psi}$, the probability of observing the $i^\text{th}$ eigenvalue, $a_i$, of the corresponding operator $\hat{A}$ is:

$$P(a_i) = \left| c_i \right|^2,$$

where $c_i$ is the coefficient of the state $\ket{\psi}$ expressed as a linear combination of eigenstates of $\hat{A}$:

$$\ket{\psi} = \sum_i c_i \ket{a_i},$$

such that

$$\hat{A}\ket{a_i} = \ket{a_i}a_i$$
