# Postulates

Quantum mechanics (the physical rules that describe the behavior of "small" stuff) is introduced as a series of postulates that, while not able to be proven, are consistent with all available experiments. 

We will discuss the following postulates to have a foundation for working with quantum information applications.

- [Postulate 1](<Postulate 1.md>)
- [Postulate 2](<Postulate 2.md>)
- [Postulate 3](<Postulate 3.md>)
- [Postulate 4](<Postulate 4.md>)
- [Postulate 5](<Postulate 5.md>)
- [Postulate 6](<Postulate 6.md>)
